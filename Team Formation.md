## Agile Process & Best Practices

- Get clear with the ask/requirement
- Sprint Planning: Estimation and Task splitting on story
- Task creation importance with title
- Sprint Retrospective
- PI (Product Increment) tagging, other tagging
- QMS Work Review
- Performance review cycle
- Readymade data for case creation to UCX (Full flow for 1 paypor)
- Small, testable, valuable should be a story within a sprint
- Agile ceremonies: say doneforyesterday and activeitemfortoday and pass on
- Acceptance criteria is required for taking up the work
- Set expectations on team members and get their expectations and aspirations; guide them on preparation
- Strict to the main point on daily standup meeting; detailing and solutioning should happen offline with individual
- Analyze the functionality and repos to change; identify dependent repos and topics on the user story as the first step; get PO review and SME review on proposed changes as part of analysis
- Focus time on Team standup: Peer review, Dev-Test Help, PO-Connect for Backlog
- Accept the story only in Ready to work state from PO
- Do the estimate for the story
- Nurture meaning of Proud and core value of CT
- Build the ability/capability in the application to perform a particular feature (based on the ask)
- Create Product backlog: todo > refinement PO+Dev team > ready to work (mark ready to work only if all queries cleared, dependencies identified, high level design workflow verified with repo owning team, bring in a call, technical and functional refinement, identify resources that need access, estimate request followup efforts) > sprint planning (team) > tasking and estimation > dev work > PO sign off > deployment > retrospective
- Take screenshot in IN verification (must)
- Tell PO in advance that time is needed for PR review with repo owner team so that time will be set
- Advice from Sagar: approach from ask perspective and analyze, not entire repo in beginning. Get clarified with refinement, dependencies, design. Otherwise you will get stuck later if focusing on all
- Enhance domain knowledge; end goal is business value addition; understand how it's helpful; get background of problem statement. Come prepared for PO sign off; you can have queries with PO if needed. Similarly, demo actual stakeholders for working feature. Leads have to ensure this with associated dev on the feature.
- Release note: build number with pipeline link. Summary of change of repo, PR. Follow Raja template for release note
- Test case coverage >80% should be ensured
- Coordinate with repo owner team SPOC for deployment and give support for post-prod verification. Utilize app insights for verification independently
- DEV also should do complete integration testing in agile
- Update confluence page with release details with CR as well
- Set clean boundaries and expectations with management, Delivery Lead, and Architects. They should not behave in embarrassing manner; it should be professional and polite on any work or urgency or priority
- Be descriptive in update on feature/user story updates; don’t plainly say Dev completed if unit testing is not done. Dev completion includes coding and unit testing
- Not overthinking on the change: need to be inline with Design and architecture of the system, so as to get the approval
