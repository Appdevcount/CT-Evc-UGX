Get clear with the ask /requirement
Sprint Planning  - Estimation and Task splitting on story
Task creation importance with title
Sprint Retrospective
PI-Product increament tagging,other tagging
QMS Work Review
Performance review cycle
Readymade data for case creation to UCX -Full flow for 1 paypor
Small, testable, valuable should be a story with in a sprint
Lot of agile ceremonies -say doneforyesterday and activeitemfortoday and pass on 
Acceptance criteria is reqired for taking up the work
Set expections on team members and get their expectations and aspirations and guide them on preparation
Strict to the main point on daily standup meeting , Detailing and solutioning should happen offline with individual
Anlayze the functionality and what are the repos which we have to make change and dependent repos and topics on the user story as the first step and get PO review and SME review on the proposed changes as part of analysis 
Focus time on Team standup -  Peer review, Dev-Test Help , PO-Connect for Backlog

Accept the story only in Ready to work state from PO
Do the estimate for the story

Nurture meaning of Proud and core value of CT

Build the ability/capability in the application to perform a partcilau feature..This is based on the ask

Create Product backlog-todo>refinement PO+Dev team-ready to work mark ready to work only if ready to work with all queries cleared,identify dependencies, high level design workflow verify with repo owning team bring in a call ,repos,techical and functional refinement,identify resources that need access and estimate request followup efforts>sprint planning(team)-tasking and estimation,>dev work>po sign off>deployment>retrospective

Take screenshot in IN verification-must

Tell PO in advance that need time for PR review with repo owner team so that time will be set

Advice from sagar- approach from ask perspective and analyze not entire repo in beginning.Get clarified with refinement , depnecies,design . Other wise you will stuck up at later point on ask if focussing on all

Enhance domain knowledge , end goal is business value addition, understand how its helpful, get background of problem statement.Come prepared in this way for PO sign off, you can have queries with PO if you need.Similarly have to demo actual stakeholders for working feature.Leads have to take care of this with associated dev on the feature to ensure taken care properly.

Release note- build number with pipeline lin. Summary of change of repo, PR.Follow Raja template for release note

Test case coverage >80% should be ensured

Coordinate with repo owner team SPOC for deployment and give support for post prod verification. Utilize app insights for verification independenntly

DEV also should do complete integration testing in agile

Update confluenec page with release details with CR as well

Set Clean boundaries and expectations with management , Delivery Lead and Architects. They should not behave in embarrassing manner, it should be professional and polite on any work or urgency or priority

Be descriptive in update on feature/ user story updates, Don’t plainly say Dev completed if unit testing is not done. Dev completion includes coding and unit testing

Not overthinking on the change - need to be inline with Design and architecture of the system , so as to get the approval
